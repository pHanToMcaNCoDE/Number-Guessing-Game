# Here's how it works:
* Welcome Messages
* When the game starts, it displays a welcome message along with the rules of the game.
* The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
* User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.
* The user should be able to enter their guess.
* If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
* If the user’s guess is incorrect, the game should display a message indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user’s guess.
* The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.
* Prompt the user if their input is not an integer
